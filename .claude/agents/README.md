# Subagents

Project subagents for DevDigest. This file is the map of the set: who does what,
with which rights, what goes in and what comes out, and where the rules come
from. The agent files themselves hold the procedures and report templates; read
those for detail, and do not copy them here.

Each file's frontmatter is its whole permission model; the body is its system
prompt. A session that started before this folder existed does not see it at all
(`Agent type '…' not found`) — restart, or check from a fresh `claude -p` session.

## At a glance

| Agent | Responsibility | Not its job | Model |
|---|---|---|---|
| [`researcher`](researcher.md) | Answers **one concrete question** with evidence — from the repo (code, config, docs, git history), external sources, or both | Changing anything; many-source narrative reports (`/deep-research`) | `sonnet` |
| [`brainstormer`](brainstormer.md) | Compares **2–4 genuinely different options** for one design decision (+ the status quo) against drivers fixed first from the repo, recommends one, leaves the pick to the user; hands the pick to planner | Planning work packages, code, web research (→ researcher), deciding for the user | `opus`, `effort: high` |
| [`planner`](planner.md) | Turns a request into a **Development Plan**: what already exists, work packages per file, the skills that bind each one, gates, acceptance criteria, test plan | Writing code, web research, review steps | `opus`, `effort: high` |
| [`implementer`](implementer.md) | Executes an **approved** plan in `server/`, `client/` (and `reviewer-core/` when the plan says so), runs the existing checks, compares its diff to the plan, hands the tests to test-writer | **Writing tests**, planning, architecture/security review, `/pr-self-review`, commits, pushes, PRs, writing `INSIGHTS.md` | `sonnet` |
| [`test-writer`](test-writer.md) | Writes **all** tests — server, client, reviewer-core, e2e flows on request — with assertions taken from the plan or spec, and proves each new test fails without its behaviour (**red-proof** in a throwaway worktree) | Production code, configs, dependencies, weakening a red test | `sonnet`, `effort: high` |
| [`plan-verifier`](plan-verifier.md) | Grades **every item** of a plan — goal, non-goals, contract, decisions, gates, each work package, acceptance criteria, test plan, docs — PASS / FAIL / UNVERIFIABLE in a traceability matrix, with its own code and test evidence | Advice, code review, an overall score | `opus`, `effort: high` |
| [`architecture-reviewer`](architecture-reviewer.md) | Checks the change against the written **architectural boundaries** (onion layering, client placement and imports, vendored twins, reviewer-core purity): rule → `file:line` → quoted evidence → severity, each finding re-verified | Security, style, tests, fixing code, the pre-push gate | `opus`, `effort: high` |
| [`security-reviewer`](security-reviewer.md) | Reports only **exploitable** problems in the change: source → sink → preconditions → exploit → confidence, severity on the repo's CRITICAL / WARNING / SUGGESTION scale, each finding re-verified; prompt-injection-shaped text listed, never followed | Architecture, style, tests, fixing code, DoS / rate limiting, the pre-push gate | `opus`, `effort: high` |
| [`doc-writer`](doc-writer.md) | Documents **implemented** behaviour from a plan, report, diff or notes, verified against the code, with Mermaid diagrams, placed by the repo's taxonomy (`<pkg>/docs/`, ADRs, `docs/`, README, `TESTING.md`) | Code, `INSIGHTS.md`, specs and `AGENTS.md` without approval, documenting plans as if built | `sonnet`, `effort: medium` |

## Permissions

| | researcher | brainstormer | planner | implementer | test-writer | plan-verifier | architecture-reviewer | security-reviewer | doc-writer |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `tools` | Read, Grep, Glob, Bash, WebSearch, WebFetch | Read, Grep, Glob, Bash | Read, Grep, Glob, Bash | Read, Grep, Glob, Bash, Edit, Write, Skill, TodoWrite | Read, Grep, Glob, Bash, Edit, Write, TodoWrite | Read, Grep, Glob, Bash | Read, Grep, Glob, Bash | Read, Grep, Glob, Bash | Read, Grep, Glob, Bash, Edit, Write, TodoWrite |
| `disallowedTools` | Write, Edit, NotebookEdit, Skill | same as planner | Write, Edit, NotebookEdit, Skill, WebFetch, WebSearch, Agent, ExitPlanMode | Agent, WebFetch, WebSearch, NotebookEdit | Agent, Skill, WebFetch, WebSearch, NotebookEdit | Write, Edit, NotebookEdit, Skill, WebFetch, WebSearch, Agent, ExitPlanMode | same as plan-verifier | same as plan-verifier | Agent, Skill, WebFetch, WebSearch, NotebookEdit |
| `permissionMode` | inherited | `default` | `default` ⚠ | `acceptEdits` | `acceptEdits` | `default` | `default` | `default` | `acceptEdits` |
| Writes files? | no | no | no | yes, guarded — no tests | test files only, guarded | no | no | no | markdown docs only, guarded |
| Bash | inspection only — by prompt | inspection only, **guarded read-only** | inspection only — by prompt, **guarded read-only** | anything except what the guard denies | + shell writes inside the red-proof worktree | inspection + test commands, **guarded read-only** | inspection, **guarded read-only** | inspection, **guarded read-only** | inspection, no shell writes |
| Hook | — | `agent-scope-guard.sh` `read-only` | `agent-scope-guard.sh` `read-only` | [`implementer-guard.sh`](../hooks/implementer-guard.sh) | [`agent-scope-guard.sh`](../hooks/agent-scope-guard.sh) `test-writer` | `agent-scope-guard.sh` `read-only` | `agent-scope-guard.sh` `read-only` | `agent-scope-guard.sh` `read-only` | `agent-scope-guard.sh` `doc-writer` |

Read-only for researcher is **two layers**: no write tools in frontmatter, and
a prompt rule against writing through Bash. brainstormer, planner,
plan-verifier, architecture-reviewer and security-reviewer get a **third**
layer — they need Bash for real work (`git log --all`, `git grep` at two
revisions, `git diff` of an uncommitted change, running the test plan): the
`read-only` guard profile, which denies redirects, `rm`/`mv`/`cp`/`tee`/`sed -i`, installs and git
state changes. A subagent's Bash cannot be narrowed by `disallowedTools` — a
command-specific entry there removes the whole tool — so a hook is the only
per-command control ([subagent docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents)).

**No web tools for security-reviewer or brainstormer.** security-reviewer
reads diff text an attacker can shape and can read private repo data; a web
tool would give it the third leg of the lethal trifecta (untrusted input +
private data + a way out — `docs/agent-prompts/security-reviewer.md` § Lethal
trifecta, [OWASP LLM01/LLM06](https://genai.owasp.org/llm-top-10/)). The
guard's matcher does not cover web tools, so `disallowedTools` is the control.
The guard also denies `curl`, `wget` and `gh api`, but it matches text and is
not a sandbox. brainstormer leaves external questions to researcher, which
keeps one agent's source discipline for the web.

⚠ **`permissionMode: plan` overrides `model: opus`.** Measured 2026-09-24 on
2.1.281: two otherwise identical subagents with `model: opus` ran on
`claude-sonnet-5` under `plan` and on `claude-opus-5-5` under `default`; the
`planner` ran on `claude-sonnet-5` while it had `plan`. So no agent here uses
plan mode: the read-only ones use `default` and rely on their tools and the
guard (planner switched on the user's decision, 2026-09-24).

No agent uses the `skills:` frontmatter or `memory:`. `skills:` is documented to
inject the full skill, but [anthropics/claude-code#67251](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/67251)
reports only the name arrives; the four newer agents instead **Read** the
`SKILL.md` sections they need by path, as `pr-self-review` does, and have
`Skill` disallowed so they cannot start a process skill with side effects
(`pr-self-review` writes `.git/devdigest/`, `engineering-insights` writes
`INSIGHTS.md`). `memory:` would silently re-enable Read/Write/Edit.

## Inputs and outputs

| Agent | Input (the delegation prompt) | Output (its final message) | Stops early with |
|---|---|---|---|
| researcher | A question with scope and an expected answer shape (yes/no, location, list, comparison) | **Repo research** or **External research** report: answer + confidence, findings with `path:line` / URL evidence, inferences, a **Not found** table, open questions | `NEEDS CLARIFICATION` — up to 5 questions and a default assumption |

| planner | A feature request or change with an outcome and a scope; optionally a researcher report, or a brainstormer report plus the user's pick | **Development Plan**: a ≤12-line **Summary** for the user, goal, non-goals, what already exists, contract, decisions, **Gates**, work packages (files · skills by § · constraints · steps · done when), order, acceptance criteria, test plan, docs to update, risks — then, after a `<!-- test-brief -->` marker, the **Test brief** (`WPn.tests` as Given/When/Then for test-writer) | `NEEDS CLARIFICATION` |
| implementer | The plan **above the marker** (verbatim, or the path of the saved file), plus which Gates the user approved; or, in a **fix round**, a self-contained list of verified findings | **Implementation Report**: status, changes per work package with changed line ranges, deviations, `check-all.sh --force` lines, unmet acceptance criteria (met ones by ID), **Handoff to test-writer** (Test brief IDs, seams, intended breaks), out-of-scope observations, **Insight candidates**. Code change left **uncommitted** | `BLOCKED` report — no plan, unapproved gate, a plan that breaks a rule |
| test-writer | The **whole** plan (Test brief included) or the WP ids / Test plan rows to cover + the implementer's handoff; or a target behaviour and its source of truth | **Test Report**: tests with their oracle source, verification (3 runs per new file, hermetic), **Red-proof** table, suspected defects (left red), not covered, insight candidates. Test files left **uncommitted** | `NEEDS CLARIFICATION` (no behaviour or no source of truth); `blocked` (needs a dependency, config or production change) |

```

Subagents cannot ask the user anything (`AskUserQuestion` is never given to a
subagent), so each one returns a `NEEDS CLARIFICATION` or `BLOCKED` block
instead, and the main session relays it. Subagents do not see the conversation
either: the plan reaches each agent only through the delegation prompt, so pass
it **verbatim** or as the path of the file it was saved to, together with which
Gates the user approved. See [§ Token budget](#token-budget) for which part of
the plan each agent gets.

**Why tests are a separate agent.** A model that writes the code and its tests
tends to shape the expected values to whatever the code returns — up to 68% of
suites from coverage-driven LLM test generators "validate bugs" instead of
catching them ([arXiv 2412.14137](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14137)); Meta's
TestGen-LLM keeps a generated test only when it builds, passes reliably and
adds coverage ([arXiv 2402.09171](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09171)). So
test-writer takes its oracles from the plan, and must show each test going red
without the behaviour. Mutation testing (Stryker) would be stronger, but it is
a new dependency; the red-proof worktree needs none.

**architecture-reviewer vs `/pr-self-review`.** Same rules, different stage.
The reviewer runs before the commit, on the working tree, on boundaries only
(groups A and C plus reviewer-core and the vendored twins), and writes nothing.
`/pr-self-review` runs on the committed branch, covers every group including
security, and writes the report the push gate reads. The reviewer reuses the
gate's `routing.md`, `greps.md` and `reviewer-prompt.md` by reference, so both
calibrate the same way; a clean architecture review does not replace the gate.

**security-reviewer vs `/pr-self-review` group E vs the built-in
`/security-review`.** The same split again. security-reviewer runs before the
commit, on the working tree, writes nothing and blocks nothing; group E runs
on the committed branch and its CRITICALs block the push. Both grade with
`docs/agent-prompts/security-reviewer.md` (the product's own prompt) and the
same CRITICAL bar, so a finding does not change severity between the two.
security-reviewer adds what a pre-commit pass can afford: exploitability
fields on every finding, an exclusion list and a confidence threshold after
Anthropic's [`claude-code-security-review`](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-security-review),
and a second pass that tries to break each finding. The built-in
`/security-review` is generic — it knows neither this stack nor this repo's
scale — and neither replaces nor is replaced by the other two. A tenancy
hit (`onion-13-tenancy-guard`) may be reported by both reviewers; the main
session merges them when relaying.

**brainstormer vs researcher vs planner.** researcher answers one question
with evidence; brainstormer makes the options for one decision comparable;
planner plans one chosen design. brainstormer goes first only when there is
a real choice (planner's Step 0 otherwise stops at "a decision between A and
B"), has no web tools and hands external unknowns to researcher, and ends
with a **Handoff to planner** block: the decision, the user's pick, the
drivers to honour and each rejected option — which planner copies into its
Decisions table as the rejected alternatives.

**plan-verifier vs the implementer's own check.** The implementer's "check the
diff against the plan" is a self-assessment and its report is a claim;
plan-verifier re-derives every verdict from the code and from commands it runs
itself, on a different model. Per-item binary grading is used instead of a
holistic score because it agrees with human judgement markedly better
(CheckEval, [arXiv 2403.18771](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18771); TICK,
[arXiv 2410.03608](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03608); Anthropic,
[develop tests](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/test-and-evaluate/develop-tests)).

## Token budget

Measured on the L03 Intent Layer run, 2026-09-24 (subagent totals from the
harness's task notifications — compare stages with each other, not as bills):

| Stage | Model | Tokens | Tool calls |
|---|---|---|---|
| researcher | sonnet | 38k | 14 |
| planner | opus | 235k | 68 |
| implementer, WP0–WP8, three packages | sonnet | **417k** | **222** |
| architecture-reviewer | opus | 108k | 34 |
| plan-verifier | opus | 155k | 44 |
| implementer, fix round | sonnet | 192k | 80 |

First runs of the two newer agents, 2026-09-28 (behaviour probes, not a
feature run): security-reviewer on a one-file, 9-line change — opus, 27k, 7
calls; brainstormer on a five-option `.claude/` decision — opus, 67k, 19 calls.

Where it went: a ~25–30k-token plan, a quarter of it test cases nobody in that
iteration needed, was read by five agents and the main session; every full
report landed in the main session's context and rode along on each later turn;
the same code was explored from scratch five times; the same typecheck and
tests ran four times on one tree; one implementer carried server **and**
client reads through 222 calls; and an `.it.test` run against real stored keys
cost billed calls plus a debugging round. The changes below remove the
repetition, not a check.

**What each agent reads**

| Agent | Gets | Does not get |
|---|---|---|
| implementer | plan above `<!-- test-brief -->`; approved Gates | Test brief; in a fix round, the plan at all — only the findings |
| test-writer | the whole plan + the implementer's handoff | — |
| plan-verifier | plan above the marker (+ Test brief when tests are in the iteration), what is deferred | reports as evidence (they are claims) |
| architecture-reviewer | nothing or a range; `change-manifest.sh` → hunks, `fitness-greps.sh` → hits | whole modified files, typecheck/test runs |
| security-reviewer | nothing or a range; `change-manifest.sh` → hunks, two `fitness-greps.sh` rows, `secret-greps.sh` new hits; follows data beyond the hunk only to a source or sink | the plan, typecheck/test runs |
| brainstormer | the decision, its scope and outcome; optionally a researcher report | a plan (it comes before one) |

**Rules for the main session**

1. **Do not re-type a plan.** Save it to a file once and hand agents the
   **paths**. An over-limit message is already saved by the harness. An
   inline one arrives as the `message` input of the agent's `SubagentHandback`
   tool call — extract it from the agent's `output_file` with a script that
   writes the file and prints only its size, never by reading the transcript
   (measured 2026-09-24: the transcript's last plain assistant text was a
   3.8k-char fragment, the handback held the 39k-char plan). Relay its
   `## Summary` (`sed -n '/^## Summary/,/^## Goal/p' <file>`) and cut it at
   the marker (`awk '/<!-- test-brief -->/{exit} {print}' <file> > plan-core.md`).
2. **Ask before launching the implementer**, even after the Gates are
   answered — it is the most expensive stage, and a stop after it started
   wastes everything it read.
3. **A fix round gets a self-contained brief** — each finding with `file:line`,
   the rule and what must hold — and no plan (`implementer.md` Step 1).
4. **One ledger for checks.** `scripts/check-all.sh --force` runs in the
   implementer, at the end of test-writer and in plan-verifier (its evidence
   must be its own). The main session, architecture-reviewer and
   security-reviewer reuse the ledger: `scripts/check-all.sh` without `--force` prints recorded results for
   an unchanged tree. Editing docs, specs or `.claude/` does not invalidate it.
5. **Relay, do not re-read.** Report counts and non-PASS items to the user;
   open the full report only when asked.
6. **Stable prefix first.** When the same agent type is spawned more than once,
   start each delegation prompt with the identical constant block (paths,
   approved Gates, constraints) and put the variable instruction last — the
   prompt cache matches on prefixes. Whether a subagent's system prompt stays
   byte-identical between spawns (it may embed git status) is **unverified**:
   check `cache_read_input_tokens` in the agents' transcripts before relying
   on it.
7. **One agent per context.** Split the implementer by package when server and
   client work do not share files (the client run then does not carry server
   reads); keep sequential stages that share context in one agent.
8. **Bundled artifacts:** do not `Artifact read` a bundler page into the main
   context (it returns base64) — save it and unpack with a script, then grep.

**Deliberately not done**

- **No model downgrades.** plan-verifier stays on opus: its value is
  re-deriving the implementer's (sonnet) claims on a different model (see
  "plan-verifier vs the implementer's own check" above). The mechanical work
  moved to scripts instead, which costs no model tokens at all.
- **Read-only agents still do not write report files.** Letting planner,
  plan-verifier or architecture-reviewer write under `.git/devdigest/` would
  weaken the `read-only` guard; their reports got shorter instead (PASS rows
  as ID + evidence, deferred items as one line, scope as counts).

## Where the rules come from

Most of the rules in these agents are not new policy. They restate
project rules, recorded traps and skills so a subagent cannot miss them. When a
source changes, the agent that restates it is now stale — this table says which.

### External sources for the set as a whole

The design follows the official
[subagent docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents) (focused agents,
least-privilege `tools`, descriptions that single out one agent, `permissionMode`
precedence, frontmatter hooks), the
[skill authoring best practices](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/best-practices)
(third-person what + when descriptions, template outputs, feedback loops), and
Anthropic's [multi-agent guidance](https://claude.com/blog/building-multi-agent-systems-when-and-how-to-use-them)
(verifiers that report every failure). That same post warns that splitting one
feature into planner → implementer phases costs coordination tokens; the split
is kept here because the plan is a human-approved gate, handed over once.

## The guards

Eight of the nine agents declare a `PreToolUse` hook in their frontmatter
(researcher, which has no Bash guard, is the ninth):

- `implementer` → [`../hooks/implementer-guard.sh`](../hooks/implementer-guard.sh)
  turns the "do not touch" rules of the root `AGENTS.md` into denials, denies
  test files (test-writer owns them), and asks the user before a
  `server/src/db/schema*` or `package.json` edit.
- `brainstormer`, `planner`, `test-writer`, `doc-writer`, `plan-verifier`,
  `architecture-reviewer`, `security-reviewer` →
  [`../hooks/agent-scope-guard.sh`](../hooks/agent-scope-guard.sh) with a
  profile argument (`test-writer`, `doc-writer`, `read-only`): the same deny
  core plus an allowlist of what that agent may write.

Decision tables and tests: [`../hooks/README.md`](../hooks/README.md).

**They only run in a trusted workspace.** Claude Code skips a project agent's
frontmatter hooks until the folder is trusted, and a `claude -p` session never
counts as trusted — there these agents run **unguarded**, with only their
prompts. Accept the workspace trust dialog before relying on them, and do not
run the writing agents from `-p` scripts. (Definitions passed with `--agents`
do run their hooks; that is how the guards are verified end to end.)

## Changing an agent

- **Change together:**
  - `planner.md` Step 5 ↔ `implementer.md` hard rules ↔ `test-writer.md`
    (who writes tests, and the shape of a WP's Tests line);
  - `planner.md` § Output format ↔ `plan-verifier.md` Step 1 (item IDs per
    plan section) ↔ `test-writer.md` Step 0 (the `<!-- test-brief -->`
    marker and the `WPn.tests` blocks after it);
  - [`scripts/fitness-greps.sh`](../../scripts/fitness-greps.sh) ↔ `greps.md`
    § The patterns, `routing.md` § Vendored-contract twin check and
    `architecture-reviewer.md` Step 3 (reviewer-core purity);
    [`scripts/check-all.sh`](../../scripts/check-all.sh) ↔ the commands in
    `.github/workflows/*.yml` ↔ `implementer.md` Step 3, `plan-verifier.md`
    Step 4, `test-writer.md` Step 4;
  - `implementer.md` report ↔ `test-writer.md` input ("Handoff to
    test-writer") ↔ `plan-verifier.md` rule 2;
  - `implementer.md` skill table, `test-writer.md` Step 1 and
    `architecture-reviewer.md` Step 2 ↔ `routing.md`; `architecture-reviewer.md`
    ↔ `greps.md` and `reviewer-prompt.md`;
  - `implementer.md` rules 2 and 5 ↔ `implementer-guard.sh`; each new agent's
    hard rules ↔ its `agent-scope-guard.sh` profile; both guards' deny core
    ↔ root `AGENTS.md` § Do not touch;
  - `security-reviewer.md` ↔ `docs/agent-prompts/security-reviewer.md`
    (scale, verdict, trifecta) ↔ `reviewer-prompt.md` § The CRITICAL bar ↔
    `routing.md` § Group E (the stack preamble, quoted verbatim) ↔
    `reviewer-core/src/prompt.ts` `INJECTION_GUARD` ↔ `greps.md` /
    `fitness-greps.sh` row ids `onion-13-tenancy-guard`,
    `onion-13-config-bypass`;
  - [`scripts/secret-greps.sh`](../../scripts/secret-greps.sh) (the only copy
    of the secret patterns; its header holds the expected output — re-run it
    and `--self-test` after changing a pattern) ↔ `security-reviewer.md` Step 2
    ↔ `routing.md` § Groups row E and `pr-self-review/SKILL.md` § 3;
  - `brainstormer.md` § Handoff to planner ↔ `planner.md` Step 0 (brainstormer
    report + the user's pick) and § Decisions taken (rejected alternatives);
  - `test-writer.md` rule 3 ↔ `client/INSIGHTS.md` 2026-09-23 (remove the
    override if `user-event` / `msw` are ever installed).
- **Check that it loaded — from a fresh session.** No `claude` is on `PATH` in a
  VSCode-extension session, but `$CLAUDE_CODE_EXECPATH` points at the
  extension's native binary, so a fresh headless session is
  `"$CLAUDE_CODE_EXECPATH" -p '…' --output-format stream-json --verbose`. It
  inherits `.claude/settings.json`, but is never a trusted workspace (so no
  frontmatter hooks — see [the guards](#the-guards)).
  - **Loaded?** The `system/init` event's `agents` array lists every definition
    that parsed. `"$CLAUDE_CODE_EXECPATH" agents --json` does **not** help: it
    lists running sessions, not definitions.
  - **Right model?** Assistant events whose `parent_tool_use_id` is the
    subagent's `Agent` call carry `message.model`. A subagent that answers in
    one turn without a tool call (a `NEEDS CLARIFICATION` probe) emits **no**
    such event — read `message.model` from the transcript named by the
    `system/task_notification` event's `output_file`. Do check it: this is how
    `permissionMode: plan` was caught replacing `model: opus` with
    `claude-sonnet-5` (planner ran on Sonnet until it moved to `default` + the
    read-only guard; it now runs on `claude-opus-5-5`, 2026-09-24, 2.1.281).
  - Never report such a check as done when it could not run.
